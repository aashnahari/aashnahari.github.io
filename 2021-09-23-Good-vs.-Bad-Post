The Google search engine is a good design because it displays results in a helpful way, differing from other search engines. It shows relevant images, displays websites based on their relevance, and even has google scholar and backward image search options! There are many ways to narrow down the search results, making it an easier search experience. Even if people don't know the little ways to use Google better, they can still search on Google and get results.
