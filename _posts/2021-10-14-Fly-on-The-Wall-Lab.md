## Summary

I noticed that different groups of people outside were usually playing sports such as soccer, football, and volleyball. Also, the bleachers, as well as the perimeters of the field, are where people like to congregate. I noticed people playfully yelling at each other when they were playing sports and saying things like, “Oh come on!, Whatcha do that for!” when someone served badly in volleyball. I noticed that the people playing soccer and football were almost always boys while volleyball circles usually had a 50/50 split. The people sitting on the bleachers or on the field were mostly girls working silently together or eating. There weren’t as many people walking around on the field together, even as a group; everyone had found the place they were going to stay for a while. 

In the Intersectionality lecture, I often noticed that when there was a silence, people would feel obliged to speak and add something else. This was more noticeable between the two speakers as sometimes it felt like they had nothing more to say, and they were expecting the hosts to ask the next question. 

## Analysis

I wonder why the sports and activities seemed to be so split between genders (except for volleyball). I know many girls that play soccer, so it’s possible that people in that free period didn’t, but I’ve noticed this on multiple occasions, even during lunch. People usually shouted when they were playing sports, but barely talked if they were sitting in a group. I didn’t observe any fights happening, so I think the shouting was used as a means of communicating over distances instead of with anger, and the people who were working were trying to focus. It was slightly colder than usual during the week I was observing, so I think most people must have been inside since I only saw a few distinct groups outside at a time. 

I think that silences are often more obvious on Zoom since you can’t actually tell or give physical clues that you are done speaking. 

## Process

I worked with Aanya and we mostly tried walking around the field. I also observed by myself during lunch on the field as that is where most of the action takes place. When I was observing people I knew, especially at a close range, they often came up and talked to me which kind of ruined the idea of observing without interfering. I realized that observing from a distance or sitting on the bleachers to observe sports was one of the best approaches since it looked less strange than walking around staring at people. It was also in the center of where most people were. I learned that most people like doing active things or even just being outside working when they are free. Also, many people that are doing sports aren’t even good at it, and are barely even playing the sport; they are just trying to have a good and funny time with their friends.
