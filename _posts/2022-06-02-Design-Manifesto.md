## Manifesto:

1. **Designs should be accessible** to the widest audience possible 
2. **Designs should be adaptable** to changes without needing immense effort
3. **Designs should have continuous user input** on content first, and then design
4. **Designs should be made with open minds** to avoid disappointment when expectations aren’t met
5. **Designs should be collaborative** which requires constant feedback from all members of the team


## How it would be displayed:

This would be displayed on a web page. However, the QR code to that website would be projected on the Empire State Building at the top (where it lights up). This is to encourage the most number of people to read it since people would be curious about what the QR code led to. The news would also probably mention it which spread it to others outside of Manhattan. Also, it would be a cool use of technology. The website itself would be made to have an accessible interface with a minimalist design and lots of spacing. 

## Description:

The first point is based on class discussions about accessibility. Since everyone can only benefit from an accessible design, it only harms people to have designs that everyone can’t access. In the UK accessibility posters, many suggestions for different groups of people overlap, and rarely do they contradict each other, so it wouldn’t be too difficult to include the entire possible user base.

The second point about adaptability is something we have mentioned a few times in class. Since the world and its ideas are constantly changing, it’s important that designs are able to change alongside it with minimal effort. In the design process, care should be taken to make sure that the design will be able to be changed by the person themselves in the future, or others, through detailed documentation or other techniques.

The third point was based on my own experience in this class and how we went about collecting user input. This was how we had actually collected input, in multiple stages, so we could compare feedback on each stage and see which changes were successful. Also, since the content is arguably more important in the beginning than the design, its better to first get feedback on that and then determine which background color the user base likes the best

The fourth is just my own personal opinion coupled with how we approached the project design in this class. If designs are built around the needs of the user base instead of the designer’s own personal wants, there will be a smaller chance of disappointment since the design was built to be what people needed. Otherwise, the designer doesn’t know if or how many people even want their design.

The last point is based on my group’s experience with collaboration. In the beginning, we had issues with communication including many disagreements. However, toward the end, we were able to improve that which led to more collaborative designs and a better end product.
