## Good: **Google**

The Google search engine is a good design because it includes many features such as google scholar and reverse image search. It also sorts websites by relevance and includes some pictures at the top, helping people understand what they are looking for. Also, they are little tricks to narrow down your search results by using quotation marks, but even if you don't know them, you can still easily use the search engine. The actual design is also very clean as the background is white and not overly cluttered allowing for an easier experience as an user.


## Bad: **Remotes**

Remotes are a bad design since there are an abundance of buttons that barely anyone uses. Personally, I only use the power, arrow, and volume buttons. If you asked me, I couldn't even tell you what all of the buttons meant, proving how irrelevant most of them must be. Also, many of the buttons are very small, which means that it isn't very accessible for people without fine motor skills. The buttons can also be pressed very easily, often happening by accident, which can ruin the experience of whatever the person is watching.
